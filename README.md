## sprintr

Welcome to Sprintr, an innovative agile project management tool designed to streamline the workflow of tech teams. At the heart of Sprintr lies a unique feature: an intelligent auto-assignment system that dynamically matches tasks with team members based on their skills, focus areas, and current workload. This is achieved through a sophisticated backend logic implemented in Python and Flask, ensuring a seamless and efficient task distribution process. On the frontend, Sprintr utilizes React, providing a responsive and user-friendly interface that facilitates easy tracking and management of tasks, sprints, and team collaboration. The data management is elegantly handled by SQLAlchemy, which offers a powerful and flexible toolkit for SQL database interaction. Our aim with Sprintr is to revolutionize how tech teams approach project management by automating the allocation process, thereby allowing team members to focus more on innovation and less on administrative overhead. Dive into the world of Sprintr where managing tech projects becomes as agile as your teamâ€™s aspirations.
